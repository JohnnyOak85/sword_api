## Disclaimer

When I took this challenge, I was also doing some home improvement, so it didn't go as well as I expected it to.

## Main API

Built using TypeScript and Hapi. Manually tested all I could, seems to be working as intended when I used hardcoded mock data.

## Database

Tried to get a MySQL database online but couldn't, so I couldn't test it with actual data. I'm more comfortable with CouchDB.

## Tests

Tried to implement as much as I could remember using Mocha and Chai.

## Message Broker

Had never implemented something like it before, researched it but still couldn't get the hang of it.

## Docker

Did my best, still couldn't get it to build, must have missed some detail.

## Kubernetes

Same as docker, both aren't what I'm most comfortable with, but I do have some passing knowledge and did my best.
